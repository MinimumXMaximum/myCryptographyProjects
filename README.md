# myCryptographyProjects
A place for cryptography projects I have made from scratch, practicing Java concepts and cryptography ciphers increasing in complexity. Request.java provides a terminal interface for the different projects, allowing you to enter a code you want to encrypt and then choosing which cipher you want to use. More ciphers and functionalities (like decryption) will be added with time.
